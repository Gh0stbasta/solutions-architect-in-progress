## üß† Daily Review ‚Äì 2025-03-31

### ‚úÖ Tasks Completed

- Set up GitHub structure (`solutions-architect-in-progress`)
- Created and published project README
- Built architecture diagram using Mermaid and Excalidraw
- Wrote initial Markdown documentation (Serverless Todo API)
- Got first hands-on experience with Mermaid

### üí° Key Learnings

- **Clarity > Cleverness**  
  Clean structure and documentation are more valuable long-term than ‚Äúclever‚Äù code.

- **Documentation is not an afterthought**  
  Projects should remain understandable even after weeks or months.  
  ‚Üí Good documentation reduces friction when returning to the code.

- **Define a working style**  
  I want to create a consistent workflow:

  - Take notes directly in the `README.md`
  - Track TODOs, bugs, and progress there
  - The README becomes the **central control file** of each project

- **Visual communication matters**  
  As a future Solutions Architect, I‚Äôll need to explain tech to **non-developers** too.  
  ‚Üí **Mermaid + Excalidraw** will be my go-to tools.
