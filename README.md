## 📚 Learning Philosophy

> "You don’t need to know everything. You just need to keep learning."

My learning is:
- **Modular** – small units I can build on
- **Project-based** – not tutorial-driven
- **Minimalistic** – focused on depth, not overwhelm

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Languages**: JavaScript, TypeScript
- **Tools**: VS Code, GitHub, Docker, AWS CLI
- **Cloud**: AWS (EC2, Lambda, S3, CloudFormation, IAM)
- **Frameworks**: Node.js, Express, React
